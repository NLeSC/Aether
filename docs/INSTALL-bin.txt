The binary release of Ibis does not need any special installation.
Simply unzip the distribution where you want. You might want to set the
IPL_HOME environment variable to this location.

The Ibis software requires at least a 1.6 JDK version of Java.
Suitable versions of Java can be obtained from the web.  IBM has versions for AIX
(at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java), Oracle has versions for
Solaris, Linux, and Windows (at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html), and Apple has a
version for Mac OS X (at http://developer.apple.com/java).

Building the provided example and benchmarks applications requires
`ant', a software building tool similar to `make', but written in Java,
and well-suited for building Java software.  At least version 1.6.5 is
required. Ant is available from http://ant.apache.org.

System-specific notes

Windows 2000, Windows XP
    Install a recent Java SDK, at least 1.6. This will get installed in
    for instance "c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0". 

    You can set the IPL_HOME environment variable to this path by going to
    the Control Panel, System, the "Advanced" tab, Environment variables,
    add it there and reboot your system.
